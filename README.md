NYC49 is an interactive mapping application used to visualize the percentage of homes canvassed in each of the 100 electoral districts of NYC's City Council District 49 prior to the June 22nd, 2021 primary election.  

To access the NYC49 project, visit the [GitHub Page](https://samleblanc.github.io/NYC49/).

This tool visualizes the canvassing efforts of Ranti Ogunleye’s campaign for a NYC City Council seat, representing the North Shore of Staten Island. Ranti Ogunleye is a lifelong North Shore resident, organizer, and teacher working to build “a North Shore for All.” Please visit [Ranti’s website](https://www.ranti4si.com) to learn more about his campaign. 

The map was developed using [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), with shapefiles acquired from [NYC.gov](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page).

NYC49 is not affiliated with Mr. Ogunleye’s campaign in any official capacity, nor is it not an endorsement of any kind. The data has been graciously provided for educational purposes only.
