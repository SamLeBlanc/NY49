# NY49

NY49 is an interactive data mapping tool used for visualizing the percentage of homes canvassed in each of the 100 electoral districts of NYC's City Council District 49 prior to the June 22nd primary election.  

To access the NY49 map, please visit the associated GitHub Pages, [here](https://samleblanc.github.io/NY49/).

This tool visualizes the canvassing efforts of Ranti Ogunleye’s campaign for a NYC City Council seat representing the North Shore of Staten Island. Ranti Ogunleye is a lifelong North Shore resident, organizer, and teacher working to build “a North Shore for All.” Please visit Ranti’s website [here](https://www.ranti4si.com) to learn more about his campaign. 

The map is created using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) with shapefiles acquired from [NYC.gov](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page).

NY49 is not connected to Mr. Ogunleye’s in any official capacity, nor is it not an endorsement of any kind. The data has been graciously provided for educational purposes only.
